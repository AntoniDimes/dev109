        <p>My name is Duy, my friends call me Antoni.</p>
        <p>I'm working a part time job right now. I want to learn about coding but curently I'm still
          deciding about my future career</p> 
        <p>I want to have a job realted to coding but I dont't have a spcific job yet.</p>
        <p>I have a project called JustType. It was developed by our group as a fun and challenging way to improve 
        typing speed and accuracy. We wanted to create a game that encourages users 
        to type quickly while minimizing mistakes. JustType was also a challenge for 
        our team, as it served as a foundational project—a basic, first-level website 
        that allowed us to test our skills and learn the fundamentals of web development.</p>
